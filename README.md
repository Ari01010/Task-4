# Task-4
A REST API built with the Flask framework.
A REST API built with the Flask framework. It acts as a simple server that allows you to manage a list of users.
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. A RESTful API uses standard HTTP methods (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on data, in this case, user data.
Flask Application Initialization: The line app = Flask(__name__) creates a Flask application instance, which is the core of the web server.
In-Memory Database: The users dictionary acts as a temporary, in-memory database. It stores user information using user IDs as keys. Since it's in mem,it is a complete working example of a simple REST API for managing users. It demonstrates the core principles of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application. This API uses a simple in-memory Python dictionary to store user data, which means all data will be lost if the server is restarted.ory, the data is not permanent and will be lost if the server is stopped.

Helper Function: get_next_user_id() is a utility function that automatically generates a unique ID for a new user by finding the highest existing ID and incrementing it.

API Endpoints (Routes): The functions decorated with @app.route() are the endpoints that define what happens when a client sends an HTTP request to a specific URL. The methods parameter specifies which HTTP actions are allowed for that route.
